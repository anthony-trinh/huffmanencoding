Huffman Encoding by Anthony Trinh 



Getting Started...
This is a file compressor based on the Huffman's encoding algorithm. 



To Compress...
(1):  Download all files. 
(2):  From python shell call compress(x, y), x is the file you wish to compress, y is a blank .txt file where the binary 
      code gets copied. 
      
      

To Uncompress...
(1):  Call decompress in the python shell, uncompress(x,y), where x is the file to be uncompressed and y is final, uncompressed 
      file.
